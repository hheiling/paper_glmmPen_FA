# Introduction and Installation
This GitHub repository contains the simulation and case study materials used within the paper "Efficient Computation of High-Dimensional Penalized Generalized Linear Mixed Models by Latent Factor Modeling of the Random Effects" by Heiling et al., which describes the glmmPen_FA method. 

The code to run the glmmPen_FA method is provided in the glmmPen R package available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmPen/index.html and is also available in the GitHub respository https://github.com/hheiling/paper_glmmPen_FA.
